# README

In this application I have created ToDo Index page , where Todo can be reordered with drag and drop functionality.

For drag and drop(reordering) functionality I used -
  gem "rails-sortable"

For this application we are using ruby-2.4.1 and Rails-5.2.1

For user authentication(sign up, login) I used 
   customs methods with gem bcrypt


I have created 3 model in this application as per requirement named-
 
 User
 ToDoCategory
 SubCategory
